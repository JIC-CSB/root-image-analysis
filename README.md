# Root reconstruction and fluorescence measurement

This code implements a quantitative image analysis pipeline for the reconstruction of root cell volumes from confocal microscopy data. These reconstructed cell volumes can be used to measure fluorescence intensity in other channels in the confocal images.

## Using the code

If you're interested in using the code, we'd strongly suggest that you get in contact with us (we'd love to help!).

## Requirements

The following python packages are needed to run the code:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* PIL
* openCV (with python binding)
